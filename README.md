### Notes

- Hot reload just work in Widgets outside main function
- `Container`widget is like a div
- Always work with `SafeArea` widget will prevent future problems 
- The way of apply margins is use `EdgeInsets` methods 
- `Column` widget accept an array of widgets 
- `Column` can accept multiple params like `verticalDirection: VerticalDirection.up`
 or `mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.end`
 - Config to assets, fonts, etc must be set in `pubspec.yaml`. After config fonts you need restart project.
